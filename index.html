            <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
            <p><b>Atharva Dhakal is wanted for allegedly sitting in the 13+ seat of a black Tesla.</b> He was in the car with his sister and two cousins, with his dad driving the car and his uncle watching the outside. The crime occurred when he exclaimed his position in the car being only for minors above the age of 13. His sister, Arshia Dhakal, and his cousins, were warning him of the situation he was in and asked him to switch seats. But, he declined the offers and continued to break the law. The penalty would be 3-5 years, as said by The Department of Public Safety (DPS). Others, like Estella D. Patterson, say he might be sentenced for 10 years. <br><br><b>The 12-year-old thought of the whole situation as "a troll" and that the police do not exist,</b> which is also another felony that could add 2 years to his jail time. Further investigation is needed to find the child and put him in prison. From what we have researched, the child lives in Wake County in an Airbnb. Where the institution is, is unknown and is to be kept confidential. <br><br><b>Raleigh mayor, Mary-Ann Baldwin, has stated that,</b> "Children these ages tend to be doing illegal activities due to the state of the Internet and its influencing actions. We have had numerous cases of children being aggressive towards their parents for taking their devices away from them. We are on time for this case of Atharva Dhakal, and we will deal with his actions for good for our North Carolina."</p>
